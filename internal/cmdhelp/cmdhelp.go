Help on search query terms.

When searching for tweets, the following query terms are available.

- Unquoted words or quoted phrases define search terms.
    Examples:  cat, election, "free bird", ðŸ‘€
    Note:      Emoji work as search terms.

- Mentions of a specific user:  @username
    Tweets authored by a user:  from:username
    Replies to specific user:   to:username

- References to a specific hashtag:  #hashtag

- Multiple terms match the conjunction (AND) of terms.
    Examples:  cat apple     # matches tweets with "cat" and "apple"

- To match a disjunction of terms, use OR.
    Examples:  cat OR apple  # matches tweets with "cat" or "apple" (or both)

- To negate a term, prefix it with "-".
    Examples:  -cat food     # matches tweets with "food" but without "cat"

- To match tweets with various features:
    Links:     has:links         # tweets containing at least one URL
    Hashtags:  has:hashtags      # tweets containing at least one #hashtag
    Mentions:  has:mentions      # tweets containing at least one @mention
    Media:     has:media, has:images, has:videos

- To match tweets containing a particular URL, use "url:XXX".
    Example:  url:https://www.google.com
    Note:     Either the shortened URL (t.co) or expanded URL works.

- To match tweets in a given thread ID, use:  "conversation_id:ID"

- To match retweets of a given user, use:  "retweets_of:username"
    Note: User ID also works.

- To match tweets in a given language by two-letter code:  lang:XX
    See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes

- To match retweets (not including quotes):  is:retweet

- To match tweets written by a verified user:  is:verified

- Use parentheses for grouping.
    Example: (cat OR dog) -is:retweet @jack
    Means:   Tweets containing "cat" or "dog", excluding retweets, mentioning @jack.

		Name: "log-level",

Help for the -log-level command-line flag.

Setting the -log-level flag to a positive integer enables debug logging
for calls to the Twitter API. The value of the flag is a bit mask, comprising
the sum of terms from the following list:

  1 -- the request URL sent to the API
  2 -- the Authorization header sent to the API
  4 -- the HTTP response from the API
  8 -- the JSON response body from the API (on success)

For example, to log the request URL and the response body, set -log-level 9.
To log all of these items, set -log-level 15.
